#Tic_Tac_Toe (ISU project for ICS4U)

(Last updated on June, 8, 2015)

Mr. Stankovic gave us the opportunity of learning what ever our hearts desired for 4 weeks. I decided to learn how to use SDL2’s libraries with c++, in order to apply my knowledge learned from the 3 years of computer science. For my project I programmed a simple Tic Tac Toe game.

##Design

The states of the game contain a menu and a game state. I rendered the board with SDL2 because I found the simple lines appealing. For the sprites I found them on google images. And the text font used was myriad pro found online.

##Implementation

I decided on using SDL2’s visual library to implement in my game because it supports C++ and it would give me a good opportunity of learning how rendering works.

##Difficulties

Difficulties occurred were mostly due to misunderstanding in how to use SDL2 but were easily fixed by rereading the tutorials and googling the errors. Some other difficulties were integrating the files together with header and cpp file. I believe these difficulties positively effected me by teaching me how to overcome these errors.

##Conclusion

Overall, I think this project was a success. Many lessons were learned from creating this game and it was very satisfying seeing a visual of my program instead of the compiler’s text.
